3. Matplotlib Visualizations: Initial visualizations were created using Matplotlib to explore relationships and trends within the data. Plots include bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

4. Seaborn Visualizations: Seaborn was utilized for more sophisticated visualizations, providing deeper insights into the dataset. Heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots were employed.

5. Documentation: This README file and associated comments in the code provide clarity on the dataset, cleaning process, and visualization techniques applied.
